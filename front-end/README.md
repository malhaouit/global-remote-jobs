## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment with Vite
1. **Install Node.js:**

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. You can check this by running:
```bash
node -v
```
This should give you the current version installed. You'll also need `npm`, which comes with Node.js.

2. **Install dependencies:**

Inside front-end directory run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

Within the same directory run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
You should see your Vite-powered React app running at `http://localhost:5173`!
